          <p>
            These stats are derived from the developer APIs provided by{' '}
            <A to="aoe2.net">aoe2.net</A>. I would highly suggest checking out
            that website and supporting it! It is an awesome source of data!
            None of this would be possible without it.

        <Item question="How frequently are these stats updated?">
          <p>
            Due to the way the new apis work, these stats will updated{' '}

          <p>
            Awwwww thanks! ðŸ˜Š You can support me by buying me a coffee! Just
            click the big orange button in the navbar. Any donations will go
            strictly toward hosting costs. Right now I'm paying ~$20 a month to
            maintain this website and update stats.

        <Item question="Why do some stats look funky for 1650+?">
          <p>
            1650+ has a very limited number of games played. Thus the stats may
            look funky, especially when comparing win rate of one civ vs
            another. Short answer, not enough games! But I still wanted that
            bracket to look at high level stats.

            Don't worry! The Voobly stats are still around! I'm still working on
            the best way for those stats to live in harmony with DE stats.
